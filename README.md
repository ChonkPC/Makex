## About The Project

This is a WIP executable maker following the `.exe` format from the ChonkPC documentation.


## Built With 🐍 Python

## Getting Started

To get started, download the main.py file and place it into an empty directory. Create a new directory within with the name "executable". Place the binary generated by C-honky in there, and rename it to "CODE". Create a "CONF" file containing addresses for the CODE and DATA segments.
Here's an example:
```bash
# file structure
╠ CODE
╠ CONF
╙ DATA
    ╙ image.out # filenames can only be up to 10 bytes long 
```

CONF example:
```bash
CODE_AD=10000000
DATA_AD=100F0000
```

## Prerequisites 
Makex depends on the `rich` library to show pretty output. You can install it using:

```sh
pip3 install rich
```

## Usage
To use Makex, just run the following command

```sh
python3 main.py executable/
```

Example output:
```sh
-----------------------
Found entity -> "image2.out"
Loaded entity ["image2.out"] - Size: 0x17e1 Addr: 0x100f0000
-----------------------
Found entity -> "image.out"
Loaded entity ["image.out"] - Size: 0x17e1 Addr: 0x100f17e1
-----------------------
Table size: 0x23
CODE_AD: 0x10000000
CODE_SZ: 0x74ed8
DATA_AD: 0x100f0000
DATA_SZ: 0x2fc2
```
